# Assignment 2

Due date: 2019-08-26 5pm

Please make a (private) fork of this repository. These forks will be cloned on
the due date. Further details of this process are available on wattle.

This assignment extends the work from the labs in weeks 4 and 5. Please open
the Assignment-2-v2.ipynb notebook in jupyter.

Please disregard Assignment-2.ipynb, and only work in Assignment-2-v2.ipynb.
The first part is now similar to lab, so you may be able to copy your answers
over from the lab session. The second part is the same as the original, so if
you started working on that already you can copy your answers over.

I'm leaving the original file in place to avoid complicating the merge process
if you have made changes to it.
